# Makeathon_TUM_24

Github repository for TUM Makeathon 2024 (DevAux)

This is the github repository for our project during Makeathon 2024. Our case consisted on creating a chatbot for the recommendation of
e-cars from the Mercedes Benz platform.

For this we decided to create our own model from scratch using RASA as a framework. We collected our data from the Mercedes Website and we
developed a quick front-end using Streamlit
