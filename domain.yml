        Our Mercedes electric vehicles offer a range of stylish exterior colors, including White, Black, Red, Brown, and Black-Metallic. 
        These colors are available without any additional cost, and while we don't offer extensive customization options, you can choose 
        from our standard palette to suit your preferences.
